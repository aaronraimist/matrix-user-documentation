Matrix User Documentation is a *community* run project that hopes to
document `Matrix <https://matrix.org/>`_ from a user's perspective. This
is not official documentation from the Matrix core team.

If you are a developer trying to make a Matrix client or server, you
should check out the `Matrix Spec <https://matrix.org/docs/spec/>`_
instead.
